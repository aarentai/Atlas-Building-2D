As for the “x and y” ambiguity in indexing and displaying, I believe that calling the first two dimension in [145, 174, 2, 2] in the order of x,y is the best choice! So in array indexing, x indexes row and y indexes column, the way I typically do and the way how matplotlib shows the 2d image. When plotting the tensors, it’s just like rotate the array counterclockwise by 90 degrees. So the vertical axis is y and horizontal axis is x, which is also consistent with my knowledge. Fortunately, kirs' code has already done in this way, like the ellipse(x, y).
